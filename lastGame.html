          As you can see, the poor fish lives in huge danger. There are cats
          everywhere! One is already on top of the fishbowl. You have to get
          active now.
          <br /><br />This neighbour`s threat was successful in the past. (1.)
          Therefore type it in less than 30 sec. without any mistake into the
          textbox below. (2.)

            immediately otherwise you might lose.</u

          This was their story: <br />Two neighbours meet at the garden fence.
          One says:
          <em
            >'What's wrong with your cat? He's been running around all the
            gardens like crazy since lunchtime today.' </em
          >Hit the buttom and start. The fish is rescued, if you need less than
          1/2 minute for typing the answer that will then be shown to you!
